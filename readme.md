# Spotmapper

This repository contains a package for interacting with and manipulating maps of spots
for laser ablation analyses.

It is geared towards users of the UCSB LASS Petrochronology and SEM labs
([petrochronology.com](https://www.petrochronology.com/)), but I'll do my best to make
the package as generally useful as possible.

## Installation

Until this package is properly configured to work with a package manager, you can
simply clone this repository and import the module as you normally would.

If you're using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), you can also use the `conda
develop` command to install the package-in-development into your current environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sarttiso/spotmapper.git
cd spotmapper
conda develop spotmapper
```
Hang tight for a proper package.
